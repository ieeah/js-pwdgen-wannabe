# js-pwdgen-wannabe
Created with practice purposes, this is a basic yet functionally, password generator.

## Features
It offers the basic features of a password generator like:
- choosing the length of the generated password.
- choosing if including, or not, special characters.
- choosing if including, or not, numbers.
- choosing between:
	- all lower case
	- all upper case
	- mixed cases
- choosing if including, or not, similar characters.

### TODO's
- choosing if the newly created password should be automatically copied or not.
- adding a button for manually copying the new password.
- adding a range input for changing the password length.
- adding a strength indicator.
- adding the chance of choosing if puntuaction marks should be, or not, in the password. (splitting them from the special characters checkbox).
- still not sure if adding the chance to automatically generate a new password everytime the choosen options are being changed.
- not sure if adding the chance of generating multiple passwords at once.
